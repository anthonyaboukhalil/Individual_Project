Purpose of this program:

The patient wants to either book an appointment or verify the appointment is booked so they open the chatbot:
- The chatbot asks if there is an appointment already booked, if the user replies with any positive answer from the array or API
  the appointment is verified by either actually saving appointment dates or checking if date is valid.


- If the user responds with any negative answer that matches any string in the array, the chabot offers to book an appointment ( we can actually save info and record them into an csv or just display info after it's done.

The added feature to this build is utilizing two Google APIs, the first one confirms the location typed in by the user and then find a doctor medical clinic near that area in a specified radius (default 50 km), the second API actually calculates the distance between the location of the user and then displays the distance between the two locations. 


- Every stage of the conversation is a level:
Level 0: Registration
Level 1: Verify if meeting is booked
Level 2: Verify date

Level 3 - 12 : Getting details from the user and ranking them in the correct queue.
